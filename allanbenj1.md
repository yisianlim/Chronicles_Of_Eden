### Contribution

In this project I worked on many small mechanics. This includes, the food and potion items, which were used to interact with different npcs. I also did half of the enemy detector that opens a gate when all enemies have been killed. I also worked on fixing som animation problems for the gate script, though this wasn't used in the end. When the petrify potion script was unable to be used because of the navmesh, I implemeted the same functionality in a different script for a large enemy. I also did half of the puzzle design for the final level, all puzzled after the town. I also did some work on setting up npc and item prefabs, as well as placing some of these in the level.

## Code Discussion

### Interesting Code

The most interesting code that I worked on was the petrify potion script. This is because it required the object to detect a collision and then freeze the collidion object if it was a certain type (this was later changed to freeze itself and placed on the large chick enemy). Because of the problems of using rigidbodys with the navmesh, when it came to freezing the object, it would add a rigidbody and then add constraints to stop it from moving. As well as this, it would freeze the animation of the object so that it would be stuck in the same position it was in when it collided.

### Code Highlight

The proudest piece of code that I wrote was also the petrify potion script. It was fun and challenging figuring out ways to freeze an objects movements as well as animation. I think the code worked quite well, with a bit of polish needed, and added a nice touch when an enemy froze midstride.

## Reflection

### What I Learned

I found this project to be quite challenging as there was plenty that I needed to learn about unity and how to use it. Because of this, I often felt like I was letting my team down as I was unable to contribute as much to the code as I would have liked. I still feel that I was able to contribute in other, non-technical ways, but overall my contribution could have been bigger. Due to my limited knowledge of unity, there is plenty I could talk about, as most aspects I learned during this project. I learnt how to implement scripted objects from viewing the code that Rhys wrote, for example. I think I have developed as a programmer as I now have a new set of skills and knowledge that I can apply to future projects.

### Important Aspect

The most important aspect I learned from this was that communication and timemanegement are essential. If I had communicated better that I wasn't sure how to do some things, or if I didn't have time to implement certain things, the project may have been more polished by the end, and less rushed. This is always something I am trying to improve with each new group project, and is something I will keep in mind going forward. I will also bring my newly gained unity knowledge to any future unity projects, including, potentially, my own.
